# - Day 1-Todo-App
I have developed a to-do list application that utilizes local storage to store your tasks. This app allows you to easily add, edit, and delete your to-dos.

In addition, you can view your pending to-dos and completed to-dos separately, making it easy to keep track of your progress.

The local storage feature ensures that your to-dos are saved even when you close the app or shut down your device, so you can pick up right where you left off.

With this user-friendly and convenient to-do list app, you can stay organized and on top of your tasks with ease.
